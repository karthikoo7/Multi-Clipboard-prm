'''You want to be able to run this program with a command line argument
that is a short key phraseâ€”for instance, agree or busy. The message associated
with that key phrase will be copied to the clipboard so that the user
can paste it into an email. This way, the user can have long, detailed messages
without having to retype them.'''

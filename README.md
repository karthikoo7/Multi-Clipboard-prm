# Multi-Clipboard-prm
You want to be able to run this program with a command line argument that is a short key phraseâ€”for instance, agree or busy. The message associated with that key phrase will be copied to the clipboard so that the user can paste it into an email. This way, the user can have long, detailed messages without having to retype them.
